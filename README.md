# 🌌 Space Game — iOS Educational App

An interactive educational game developed in Swift for iOS. Designed for secondary school students, it explores space and scientific concepts using engaging gameplay powered by SpriteKit and UIKit.

## 📱 Features

- 🚀 SpriteKit-powered spaceship navigation
- 🪐 Collisions trigger educational facts about planets
- 🧠 Quiz section with true/false questions to test understanding
- 🎨 UIKit interface with storyboards and segues
- 🎮 Responsive controls using touch gestures
- 📐 MVC architecture with clean state management
- ✨ Dynamic animations and particle effects

## 🎓 Educational Goal

Designed to make scientific concepts like gravity and orbital mechanics engaging and accessible through interactive play and reinforcement quizzes.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Swift
- **IDE**: Xcode
- **UI**: UIKit + Storyboards
- **Game Engine**: SpriteKit
- **Architecture**: MVC
- **Graphics**: SKActions, SKEmitterNode, PopupNode

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the project in the latest version of **Xcode**
2. Build and run on a simulator or connected iOS device
3. Start from `HomeScreenController` and begin exploring!

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Navigate a spaceship through a solar system with interactive planets and asteroids.
- Collide with planets to reveal educational facts.
- Take a quiz based on what you've encountered.
- Receive instant feedback and a score summary.

## 🔁 Game Flow

1. Start screen (Home)
2. Gameplay scene (SpriteKit)
3. Planet interaction (Popup)
4. Quiz view (UIKit)
5. Results and replay options

## 🔍 Technical Highlights

- Physics bodies for spaceship/planet collisions
- SKEmitterNode for visual particle effects
- UIKit + IBOutlet/IBAction for quiz interaction
- Real-time UI updates with score tracking
- Storyboard-based transitions and navigation

## 🔬 iOS vs Android Reflection

This project was built as a counterpart to an earlier Android game. Comparing development:
- Swift offers elegant syntax and safer memory handling
- SpriteKit simplifies animation and physics vs. manual Kotlin logic
- UIKit provides a rich, consistent interface design experience
- Android required more manual setup for collision detection and movement

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Multiplayer mode
- ARKit support for real-world exploration
- Expanded quiz topics and dynamic question banks
